packages imported are:
1: Speech_recognition.
2: pyttsx3.
3: pywhatkit.
4: datetime.
5: wikipedia.
6: pyjokes.
7: pyAudio.

<!-- For some reason pip does not work, instead you could try first installing "pipwin" if you don't already have it Open a cmd and paste this:

pip install pipwin
and then install PyAudio using:

pipwin install pyaudio
It should work. But if you don't want to use pipwin.. just install it and then uninstall it afterwards by simply using:

pip uninstall pipwin -->
